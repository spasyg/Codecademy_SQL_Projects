Learning points
The churn rate is a percent of subscribers at the beginning of a period that cancel within that period. “Monthly churn” is a typical metric and what was used in the examples.
How to calculate this metric using SQL for a single month. This used COUNT() and conditions to determine the number of subscribers that were active and how many canceled.
A more complex method to track the subscriber churn rate over many months.

Source table is:
subscriptions 1000 rows
id	INTEGER
subscription_start	TEXT
subscription_end	TEXT


WITH months AS (
  SELECT
    '2017-01-01' AS first_day,
    '2017-01-31' AS last_day
  UNION
  SELECT
    '2017-02-01' AS first_day,
    '2017-02-28' AS last_day
  UNION
  SELECT
    '2017-03-01' AS first_day,
    '2017-03-31' AS last_day
),
cross_join AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM subscriptions
  CROSS JOIN months
),
status AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    first_day AS month,
    CASE
      WHEN (subscription_start < first_day)
        AND (
          subscription_end > first_day
          OR subscription_end IS NULL
        ) THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END AS is_active,
    CASE
      WHEN subscription_end BETWEEN first_day AND last_day THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END AS is_canceled
  FROM cross_join
),
status_aggregate AS (
  SELECT
    month,
    SUM(is_active) AS active,
    SUM(is_canceled) AS canceled
  FROM status
  GROUP BY month
)
SELECT
  month,
  1.0 * canceled / active AS churn_rate
FROM status_aggregate;

output is:
month	churn_rate
2017-01-01	0.126811594202899
2017-02-01	0.124505928853755
2017-03-01	0.23688155922039
